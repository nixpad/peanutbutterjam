<h2>Decaf Prototype Readme File</h2>

Welcome, and thank you for reading me.  Please feel free to browse the <a href="doc/frameset.html">documentation</a>
before getting started with the prototype demonstration.  When you're ready, unzip the 
<a href="decaf_binaries.zip">prototype binaries</a> onto a writable drive on a PC (the 
demo C++ application is platform-specific and has only been compiled for Windows; please contact me if this 
is a problem).  Java version 1.4 or later is required to run the prototype.  If you have Java installed already, enter
<code>java -version</code> at a command prompt to see what version it is.  If you need to install a compatible
version of Java, please run the file <b>JRE1-4-1.exe</b> in the root directory of this CD.  To configure the
demonstration, go to the <b>decaf_demo/</b> directory that was created when you unzipped the prototype binaries and
run the script <b>install.bat</b> from a command prompt.  It will ask you for the location of 
two Java binary files, and will give default locations in [square brackets].  The default locations are usually 
correct; press enter to accept them.  If there are problems starting Decaf or the demo application uMail, run this
install script again and verify that the filenames are correct.  The <a href="doc/frameset_pl.html">packing</a> list 
for the various contents of this distribution resides here.
